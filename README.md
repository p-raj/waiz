**TL;DR** – Possible, but have to be categorized topic-wise and per topic there have to be multiple databases with a primary focus on time to go through the content.

### How this would work – for example: Topic: Books. Possible Databases (sources)
- eBooks – Full Length, slowest source
- Audio Books – Full Length, but faster than reading a book
- Youtube Interviews (author’s speeches, Q&A with author) – specific topics and
chaperts from the book
- Twitter threads & #<topic> - any length of threads could be expected
- Blinkist – 15 minutes for a non-fictional book
- User Annotations – eg: genius.com, hypothes.is – most-highlighted line

### MVP (minimal viable product) – Only data source – Twitter Threads Information in twitter threads
- Length of threads
- Words per thread (max 240)
- Popularity of a particular thread (there are multiple threads per book, multiple
perspectives)
- Popularity of a specific tweet in the thread (#of comments, #of likes)
### User Interaction –
- Dedicated web-site, single page website, exactly like google homepage - User would enter – Book: Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder
- User would be able to see
    - Query box with the information(exactly like google)
    - Tags for the query
        - Type: book
        - Amazon Link
        - Good Reads link
        - Business & Economics 
        - Top 100 books of year
    - Book’s brief description
        - Books cover
        - Author

        - Author of the source
        - Link to the source
